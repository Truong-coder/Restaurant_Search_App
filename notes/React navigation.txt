Required React Navigation Installation Update
At the end of the next lecture, we will be installing the React Navigation library to use in our project. 
Please read the following important information and updated installation instructions:

Important Message about React Navigation
This project will be using the v4 version of React Navigation. To date, this code still works as expected. 
The v4 version is still important to know and understand as it is used widely in existing codebases in many organizations. 
I highly encourage you to continue with the course as it is so that you fully understand how React Navigation works. 
Once you have finished the course, you can use this as a self-study opportunity to attempt a migration of your finished working projects. 
The docs provide some great resources on this: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/5.x/upgrading-from-4.x

1. React Navigation v4 Installation
note: You cannot mix Yarn and npm in the same project as it will break your dependencies. 
You must consistently use the same package manager. If you have yarn installed on your computer 
it will be used by default to generate the project. In this case, you must use Yarn to install your dependencies.

1. Install React Navigation

npm install react-navigation --legacy-peer-deps

or

yarn add react-navigation

2. Install Dependencies

npx expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

3. Install React Navigation Stack

npm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view --legacy-peer-deps

or

yarn add react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view

4. Find the babel.config.js file and add the following line to the return:

    plugins: ["react-native-reanimated/plugin"],
